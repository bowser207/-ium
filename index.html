            There's Hydrogen and Helium
Then Lithium, Beryllium
Boron, Carbon everywhere
Nitrogen all through the air
With Oxygen so you can breathe
And Fluorine for your pretty teeth
Neon to light up the signs
Sodium for salty times
Silicon
(Phosphorus, then Sulfur) Chlorine and Argon
(Potassium) And Calcium so you'll grow strong
(Scandium) Titanium, Vanadium and Chromium and Manganese
This is the Periodic Table
Noble gas is stable
Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
Each period will see new outer shells
While electrons are added moving to the right
Iron is the 26th
Then Cobalt, Nickel coins you get
Copper, Zinc and Gallium
Germanium and Arsenic
Selenium and Bromine film
While Krypton helps light up your room
Rubidium and Strontium then Yttrium, Zirconium
Molybdenum, Technetium
(Ruthenium) Rhodium, Palladium
(Silver-war) Then Cadmium and Indium
(Tin-cans) Antimony then Tellurium and Iodine and Xenon
And then Caesium and
Barium is 56, and this is where the table splits
Where Lanthanides have just begun
Lanthanum, Cerium and Praseodymium
Neodymium's next to
Promethium, then 62's
Samarium, Europium, Gadolinium and Terbium
Dysprosium, Holmium, Erbium, Thulium
Ytterbium, Lutetium
Hafnium, Tantalum, Tungsten then we're on to
Rhenium, Osmium and Iridium
Platinum, Gold to make you rich till you grow old
Mercury to tell you when it's really cold
(Thallium) And lead then Bismuth for your tummy
(Polonium) Astatine would not be yummy
(Radon) Francium will last a little time
(Radium) then Actinides at 89
This is the Periodic Table
Noble gas is stable
Halogens and Alkali react aggressively
Each period will see new outer shells
While electrons are to the right
Actinium, Thorium, Protactinium
Uranium, Neptunium, Plutonium
Americium, Curium, Berkelium
Californium, Einsteinium, Fermium
Mendelevium, Nobelium, Lawrencium
Rutherfordium, Dubnium, Seaborgium
Bohrium, Hassium then Meitnerium
Darmstadtium, Roentgenium, Copernicium
Nihonium, Flerovium
Moscovium, Livermorium
Tennessine and Oganesson
And then we're done

            3.14159, this is pi
            Followed by 2-6-5-3-5-8-9
            Circumference over diameter
            7-9, then 3-2-3
            OMG! Can't you see?
            8-4-6-2-6-4-3
            And now we're on a spree
            38 and 32, now we're blue
            Oh, who knew?
            7,950 and then a 2
            88 and 41, so much fun
            Now we run
            9-7-1-6-9-3-9-9
            3-7, 51
            Halfway done!
            0-5-8, now don't be late
            2-0-9, where's the wine?
            7-4, it's on the floor
            Then 9-4-4-5-9
            2-3-0, we gotta go
            7-8, we can't wait
            1-6-4-0-6-2-8
            We're almost near the end, keep going
            62, we're getting through
            0-8-9, 9 on time
            8-6-2-8-0-3-4
            There's only a few more!
            8-2, then 5-3
            42, 11, 7-0 and 67
            We're done! Was that fun?
            Learning random digits
            So that you can brag to your friends</i>
